## Introduction
Welcome, we’re <strong>Ohana</strong>, and we’ve developed an innovative system specifically designed to support individuals who are both deaf and blind: <strong>TacticWave</strong>. Our solution empowers users to perceive and respond to their surroundings by converting spoken language into tactile vibrations felt through a wearable device. By integrating speech-to-text technology, emotion detection, and tactile feedback, we enable real-time communication and enhance safety by identifying urgent messages and emotional cues. In addition, TactiWave offers a unique emergency alert feature that uses specific tactile patterns to signal danger or critical situations, ensuring users can respond promptly to emergencies. With TactiWave, we aim to break down barriers and create a more inclusive world for those facing dual sensory challenges.
